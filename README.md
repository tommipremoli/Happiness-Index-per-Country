# Happiness Index per Country - Group Project
This work uses data from the World Happiness Report to explore factors influencing well-being across countries. Through unsupervised learning models like clustering and PCA, we aim to uncover patterns in happiness, considering variables such as trust, freedom, income, and health to better understand global differences in life satisfaction.
